# MOC Tree

Project overview.

- `/tls`: tools for general usage, mainly for development purposes (e.g. vector printout, map printout). Files `.h` to be included into each script (`.cpp`) [^1].
  - `/tls_display.h`
- `/obj`: 
  - `/Components`
  - `/Libraries`
  - `/Machines`
- `/res`: 
- `/src`: 

[^1]: `.h` files includ both declarations and definitions. This ease writing the compiling instruction for the `.cpp` that imports them.
